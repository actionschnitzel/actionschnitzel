I'm just a guy who loves to take things apart, put them back together and then see if it still works. My focus is on frontend software for the Raspberry Pi.

As for the Pi, I always try to be up to date. Discovering new software and hardware is a lot of fun and also benefits PiGro.

PiGro (Xtrmo) is my heart project. I still have a lot of ideas and will continue to refine them. I've been thinking about bringing out a Debian version for a long time. The biggest problem (which others have too) is that everything is aimed at the USER PI, which means a lot of work to get it running on other distros. … Sometime!!

I've always been “the go to guy” when it comes to IT. When I was 10, I inspected my family's first office computer, scoured the Windows folder and read all .INI files (no kidding). In 2003 I had enough of Windows and bought the “Easy Linux Magazin” with a SuseLinux 9.0 CD. Good Guy UT2003 had a Linux installer and I had everything I need xD. After a while, I came to Linux Mint via Ubuntu and stayed. In 2020 Corona came and I decided to push my IT knowledge even further (there was nothing else to do). So I bought a Raspberry Pi and started building.
